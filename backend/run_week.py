"""Lead: run_week() runs the full pipeline in order —
gather -> check -> score -> analyze -> store — and returns results for the
dashboard.

Gather uses the real Gatherer (backend/gatherer/): Telco customer feedback +
Verizon/AT&T/Xfinity Play Store reviews. Score uses our own scorer.py
(LLM-based theme discovery) since no separate Scorer teammate branch exists yet."""
