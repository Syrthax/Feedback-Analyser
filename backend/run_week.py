"""Lead: run_week() runs the full pipeline in order —
gather -> check -> score -> analyze -> store — and returns results for the
dashboard.

Gather uses the real Gatherer (backend/gatherer/): Telco customer feedback +
Verizon/AT&T/Xfinity Play Store reviews. Score uses the real scorer.py
(LLM-based theme discovery).

One run analyses ONE business's own reviews. The cleaned CSV holds several
businesses (Telco, its competitors under origin=market, and every shop
analyse_shop.py has appended), and loading a whole week used to score all of
them as one: Verizon's app-update complaints came out as Telco's -5."""
