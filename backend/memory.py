"""Lead: Hindsight Cloud integration. Stores each week's result and recalls
past weeks so the Analyst can reason about trends across weeks.

Every memory is scoped to one business. The bank is shared by every flow
(run_week's Telco weeks, every shop analyse_shop looks up), and before this
scoping a recall for "Overpriced chai at Niloufer Cafe" came back with 26 Telco
memories, which the Analyst then cited as the cafe's "past trend". Now each
retain is tagged `business:<slug>` and recall filters on that tag with
any_strict, which also excludes the older untagged memories."""
