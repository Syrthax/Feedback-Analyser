"""Scorer: groups verified reviews into themes.

Based on the original Scorer implementation, with fixes applied on top of
its logic for real-data integration:
  1. `from backend.llm import call_llm` -> `from llm import call_llm` (our
     backend/ package runs flat, not as `backend.*`).
  2. `call_llm(prompt)` -> `call_llm(SYSTEM_PROMPT, prompt, ...)`: our
     call_llm requires a system prompt and a user prompt, not one string.
  3. Sends every verified review in one prompt with no sampling. Tested
     against real week-1 data (604 reviews, ~52,000 tokens) and got a hard
     Groq 413: our plan's rate limit is 8,000 tokens PER MINUTE, shared with
     the Analyst's own calls in the same run -- so this silently returned []
     for any real week (call_llm's fallback swallows the error). Fixed by
     sampling the input down to a token budget that leaves headroom for the
     Analyst's calls in the same run_week() execution.
     Tradeoff: "count" is now based on the sample, not an exact count across
     every verified review that week -- acceptable for relative theme
     importance, but not a precise total. Flagged here rather than silently
     shipped, in case real usage numbers matter later.
  4. Also found (separately, same real-data run): the model occasionally
     writes a count as a word instead of a digit (e.g. `"count": seventy`),
     which breaks json.loads() -- and that happened *after* call_llm already
     succeeded, so call_llm's own retries never saw it and this function
     just returned [] with no visibility into why. Tightened the prompt's
     wording and added a retry around the parse step (not just the API call)
     so one malformed response doesn't waste the whole extraction.

Numeric scoring (-5..+5) is the Analyst's job (see analyst.py), using
Hindsight-informed reasoning -- this module only needs to return
[{"name", "count", "samples"}, ...] per the agreed interface."""
