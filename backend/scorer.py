"""Scorer: the sorter. Groups verified reviews into themes.

Numeric scoring (-5..+5) is the Analyst's job (see analyst.py), using
Hindsight-informed reasoning -- so this module only needs to return
[{"name", "count", "samples"}, ...] per the agreed interface.

No separate Scorer teammate branch exists yet, so this discovers themes with
an LLM instead of a hardcoded keyword list, so it generalizes to any dataset
(Telco this week, a different business next week) rather than only the one
domain we happened to test against."""
