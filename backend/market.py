"""Market scan: the "similar market" branch of the Gatherer, plus a summary
the Analyst can reason with.

For a shop: find the busiest places of the same kind nearby (or take the names
the caller gives), pull a small batch of each one's newest reviews, filter them
through the Checker, and ask Groq once for each competitor's strengths and
weaknesses. For a gathered week: the same summary over the market rows
gatherer_config.json already collected for that week.

Everything here is optional to the run: a competitor that can't be found or
fetched becomes a warning, and a failed summary still lists the competitors.
One Groq call covers every competitor, because the plan's 8,000 tokens per
minute is shared with the Scorer and one Analyst call per theme."""
